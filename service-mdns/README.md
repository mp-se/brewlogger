# docker-mdns-repeater

This image uses Darell Tan's mdns-repeater to bridge/repeat mDNS requests between two network interfaces. 

The intended use of this container is to allow a docker-compose stack running in `net=bridge` mode to be able to communicate with the Docker host's external network.

Image on Docker Hub: https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/jdbeeler/mdns-repeater


## Using this container

This container was designed to be used as part of a docker-compose stack. When creating the configuration file:

1. Use docker-compose version 3.5 or later
2. Ensure that each of the bridged containers are part of the same, named network
3. Ensure that the network is named in the `networks:` section
4. Create & link an environment variable file similar to [env.sample](env.sample) to your mdns_repeater image (or set the appropriate environment variables in the stack's configuration)

See `mdns_repeater` in the example docker-compose file below for the other attributes necessary to run the container.

There are three environment variables that must be set:
- **EXTERNAL_INTERFACE** - The interface name of the external interface we want to bridge (e.g. `eth0`, `wlan0`, etc.)
- **DOCKER_NETWORK_NAME** - The name of the named network in the stack (`walled` in the example below)
- **USE_MDNS_REPEATER** - A flag that can be used to disable the application. Intended use case is if we want to disable the repeater from an environment variable (without needing to edit `docker-compose.yml`)
